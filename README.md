# analysis_of_network_data

Study algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems with focus on networked systems. These algorithms solve problems that arise in various practical scenarios, including airline companies scheduling their flights, large companies deciding what and where to stock in their warehouses, delivery companies choosing the routes, Google ranking search results, and Netflix choosing which movies to recommend.

Study general combinatorial problems on graphs, each modeling various practical problems of interest. We focus on general and powerful algorithmic techniques for each problem.
